Airway epithelium is composed of well-differentiated cells in a pseudostratified layer. In collective cell migration through the unjamming transition (UJT), the specific role and regulation of each differentiated cell type are unknown. In this study, we induced UJT and measured changes in basal cells. Morphology changes in basal cells implicate their biophysical role in driving collective cell migration.

## Detailed Methods:
* Primary human bronchial epithelial cells from a donor with no known lung disease were cultured in transwells first in submerged condition for 4-6 days followed by 14-17 days in air-liquid interface (ALI) in a defined, serum-free media. [Further details in (Park 2010).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20650887/)
* **Mechanical Compression**-induced Unjamming Transition ([Further details in (Park 2015).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26237129/))
    + Cells exposed to apical-to-basal pressure differential of 30 cm H2O for 3 hours
* **Irradiation**-induced Unjamming Transition ([Further details in (O'Sullivan 2020).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32117962/))
    + Cells exposed to ionizing radiation at a dose of 1 Gy on days 7, 10, and 14 of ALI culture
* **Data Collection** at 24 *or* 72 hours after final treatment (mechanical compression or irradiation):
    + **Time-Lapse Imaging** 6 fields of view were randomly selected and imaged (phase contrast) over 1.5 hours
    + **F-actin Imaging** wells were fixed and stained for F-actin; 5 fields of view were randomly selected and imaged in a z-stack from apical to basal-substrate plane
* **Image Analysis**
    + **Migration Speed** a 10 micron grid was overlaid in the first frame of the time-lapse movie and migration paths were estimated using optical flow Farneback method ([MATLAB code](https://github.com/tkphung/track-cells-matlab))
    + **Cell Shape Segmentation** From z-stack images, maximum intensity projections were generated at different heights to visualize the apical cell boundaries, basal cell boundaries, and stress fibers. Cell boundaries were segmented using marker-controlled watershed segmentation in MATLAB.
    + **Stress Fiber Segmentation** Stress fibers were segmented using a combination of a tracing algorithm developed by [Rogge+ 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.12593) and a fiber reconstruction algorithm developed by [Zhang+ 2017](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1684-y). ([MATLAB code](https://github.com/tkphung/SegmentFibers))
* Comparing metrics:
    + Each z-stack generated a apical, basal, and stress fiber field of view. For comparisons between morphology metrics, the average value was taken over each field of view.
    + The time-lapse and F-actin fields of view were not spatially matched. However, they were taken from the same experimental wells. To compare a morphology metric to migration speed, we averaged metrics over all (5) fields of view for each well. And we averaged migration speed over all (6) fields of view for each well.
