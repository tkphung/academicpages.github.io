IDEAs lab is a third year undergraduate course for biomedical engineering majors to integrate concepts and skills from prior courses in order to formulate and solve problems in biomedical systems, including experimental design, performance, and analysis.

I assisted with two lab modules:
* *Biomechanics*- mechanical testing of chicken skin samples; fitting a computational model to mechanical test data
* *Drug Delivery*- creating and analyzing dye-loaded, ligand-targeted liposomes

I also advised 6 groups of students for *biomechanics*-related final projects:
* Mechanical testing of chicken and pig tendons
* Mechanical testing of bandage adhesives
* Mechanical testing of hernia meshes
