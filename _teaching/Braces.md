I worked with a team of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Memphis for the Society for Biomaterials' [*Biomaterials Education Challenge*](https://www.biomaterials.org/students/biomaterials-education-challenge). We developed an educational module to demonstrate fundamental biomaterials concepts to middle school science classes using dental braces.

**What Makes Your Braces Smart?**

*All about Dental Materials and Their Properties*

This middle school science lesson on biomaterials will teach students about the different types of biomaterials that are used in dental braces.  Through a class demonstration, group experiment, and a Powerpoint presentation, students will learn about polymers, metals, and ceramics and how they differ from one another.  Students will be introduced to material property concepts including, ductile, brittle, fracture, deformation, etc.  An example of a “smart” material, Nitinol, will also be introduced and students will experiment with pieces of Nitinol wire. Nitinol is an alloy of nickel and tin that possesses super elastic and shape memory properties.  Practical examples will be used to demonstrate to students the different applications of polymers, ceramics, and metals in the body.  A worksheet is provided and teachers will review all of the data and calculations the students obtained at the end of the lesson.

*This module placed 4th in the inaugural Biomaterials Education Challenge.*
