I mentored a biomedical engineering undergraduate student in the [Cardiac Biomechanics Group](https://engineering.virginia.edu/cardiac-biomechanics-group "CBG website") for a semester-long research course. Her project was *validating a patient-specific electromechanical activation model of the heart*.
