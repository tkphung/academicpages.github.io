Computational Biomedical Engineering is a second year undergraduate course for biomedical engineering majors. The topics covered numerical methods and their implementations in MATLAB.

I was funded as part of the [Graduate Teaching Internship Program](https://engineering.virginia.edu/graduate-teaching-internship-gti-program) at the University of Virginia. I was listed as co-instructor with Professor [Gustavo Rohde](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/gustavo-kunde-rohde) for the course.
