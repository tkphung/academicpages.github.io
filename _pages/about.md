I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow the [Park Lab](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/park-lab/ "Park Lab website") at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I am interested in cellular mechanics of airway epithelial cells during jamming and unjamming transitions.

I was previously a member of the [Cardiac Biomechanics Group](https://engineering.virginia.edu/cardiac-biomechanics-group "CBG website") at the University of Virginia. During my graduate research, I developed computational electromechanical models to clinically guide cardiac therapies.
