*Review Paper*

In asthma, progressive structural changes of the airway wall are collectively termed airway remodelling. Despite its deleterious effect on lung function, airway remodelling is incompletely understood. As one of the important causes leading to airway remodelling, here we discuss the significance of mechanical forces that are produced in the narrowed airway during asthma exacerbation, as a driving force of airway remodelling. We cover in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo work in this field, and discuss up-to-date literature supporting the idea that bronchoconstriction may be the missing link in a comprehensive understanding of airway remodelling in asthma.
