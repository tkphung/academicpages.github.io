Airway narrowing due to hyper-responsiveness severely limits gas exchange in patients with asthma. Imaging studies in humans and animals have previously shown that bronchoconstriction causes patchy patterns of ventilation defects throughout the lungs, and several computational models have predicted that these regions are due to constriction of smaller airways. However, these imaging approaches are often limited in their ability to capture dynamic changes in small airways, and the patterns of constriction are heterogeneous. To directly investigate regional variations in airway narrowing and the response to deep inspirations, we utilized tantalum dust and microfocal X-ray imaging of rat lungs to obtain dynamic images of airways in an intact animal model.
