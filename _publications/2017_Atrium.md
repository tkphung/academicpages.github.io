Atrial fibrillation (AF) is often treated with catheter ablation, which induces scar formation to isolate misfiring electrical signals in the left atrium. Successful ablation restores sinus rhythm at the cost of replacing viable myocardium with scar. The impact of ablation scar on mechanical function of the left atrium is poorly understood. A coupled finite‚Äêelement and hemodynamic circuit model of the left atrium that represents the regional and global mechanics in paroxysmal AF patients was modified to simulate different ablation patterns.
