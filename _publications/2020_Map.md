Patient-specific modeling has tremendous potential for allowing researchers and clinicians to simulate how injuries and therapies affect the heart. This project provides [MATLAB and Python code](https://simtk.org/projects/lvdatamap) to register multiple imaging protocols to create a patient-specific finite element mesh of a left ventricle suitable for simulation in FEBio. Additionally, this data mapping routine is being used in a [randomized clinical trial to guide cardiac resynchronization therapy](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03398369).
